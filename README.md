# unisex bathroom problem

There is one bathroom with an finite number of toilets that both men and woman can use. Men and women can't be in the bathroom at the same time, but if a man is in the bathroom, other man can get in, but if a woman want to use the bathoom she should wait for all men get out. The same rule works if a woman is in the bathroom and a men show up. Each person will spend some a random time using the bathroom.
